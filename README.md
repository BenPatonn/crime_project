	Located in folder within directory:
	'/crime_data_outputs/aggregated_dataframes/'

D) How processes are separated between Staging, Primary and Reporting layers (see docstrings for specific applications to each dataframe):
	Staging:
		Loads, processes, and outputs data from various CSV datasets, performing the necessary staging 
    		transformations for each dataset. This includes concatenating, renaming columns, and performing
    		other transformations like converting dates and formatting text

	Primary:
		Merges, filters, rounding, splitting columns, replacing specific column values, rounding values are performed, 
		preparing it for reporting.

	Reporting:
		Aggregates and summarizes processed datasets for reporting purposes, generating key insights like crime 
        	counts per area, outcomes, and other indicators.
